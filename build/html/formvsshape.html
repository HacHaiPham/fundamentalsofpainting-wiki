</div>
<p>Traditional Painting principles establishes principles that you can use to paint, design and modify your “style”
however you like. Now it is not about the technique, but about the mindset, that you use to create your paintings.
In Traditional Painting it isn´t only about technique, but about a way of thinking. And that way of thinking can be
applied to Digital Painting as well. I call it the “Shape Mindset”, (you can also call it Direct Painting or Alla Prima
Painting, if you want to use the proper term(not meaning wet-into-wet but the mindset behind it)).</p>
<p>Here are common problems when not employing the “Shape Mindset”:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Muddy colors</li>
<li>No sense of light</li>
<li>Bad form lighting</li>
<li>Random composition</li>
<li>No sense for Shape Design</li>
<li>Chaotic rendering approach</li>
</ol>
<p>Let´s dive a bit deeper.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="touch">
<h2>#2: Touch<a class="headerlink" href="#touch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For starters, the biggest problem is our default drawing mode: our affinity to the Touch sensation. You might be
great at drawing. Naturally, we all started with the pencil.
But when you start using Photoshop or painting, you feel uncomfortable. Or you don´t know how to approach Oil Painting and
Watercolor. The reason?
We are associating what we see with a sense of touch. This is the method of drawing, that was developed in
Western Art History.
The sense of touch was first important to us for survival. If we were to develop a sense of depth we needed to
connect the sense of touch with what we SEE. Or else we wouldn´t have a sense of space.
So for a beginning artist, this connection of -Form- with -Sight- makes us more inclined with drawing form rather than
using masses and shapes as a means of drawing.
This sense of touch was already found already in Egyptian Art, which is the foundation of Western Art. You can
see how the Egyptian Drawing below is equivalent to us going with our fingers along the contours of our face and
body. This is all connected to the sense of touch.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id1">
<img alt="_images/Ägyptischer_Maler_um_1360_v._Chr._001.jpg" src="_images/Ägyptischer_Maler_um_1360_v._Chr._001.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Egyptian Painting – 1360 B.C.</span></p>
</div>
<p>This sense of touch was pushed to near perfection in the Renaissance. Below we have a fuller representation of
Form, which was the natural progression of Western Art. Michelangelo was a Master of Forms. Notice how to
use overlaps and hatching to convey the 3-dimensionality of form. There is absolutely no sense for “true” values
and “true” colors. Again, Forms are very conceptional, because it is something we feel, instead of really seeing it
with our vision.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id2">
<img alt="_images/study-for-an-ignudo.jpg" src="_images/study-for-an-ignudo.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Michelangelo – Study for an ignudo</span></p>
</div>
<p>Linear Perspective and Space are all provinces of Forms. You probably already study perspective and this
concept is not new to you.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id3">
<img alt="_images/perspectival-study-of-the-adoration-of-the-magi.jpg" src="_images/perspectival-study-of-the-adoration-of-the-magi.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Leonardo Da Vinci – Perspective Study of the Adoration of the Magi</span></p>
</div>
<p>All of this can be drawn from imagination because the feeling for Forms always stays the same, no matter from
what direction we “touch” it. When thinking about Forms, our skill level is depended on our knowledge of these
Forms and the representation in Space, which is why the study of Anatomy, Structure and Perspective is so
important.
Ingres followed through with the idea of Form in later centuries. He was one of the greatest when looking at it´s
beauty and he pushed it to almost perfection.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id4">
<img alt="_images/Etude_Venus_a_Paphos_Ingres_1852.jpg" src="_images/Etude_Venus_a_Paphos_Ingres_1852.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres – Etude Venus a Paphos(1852); As seen in this drawing, shape and color, which are
connected to Vision, are completely neglected, and the whole drawing is ONLY associated with the sense of touch</span></p>
</div>
<p>Below you can see the perfect rendering of forms and materials(also by Ingres). This is masterful craftsmanship;
almost all illustrators strive to be able to paint like that.
But still, there is practically no sense of light and color(only sense of form), which is why we need to go further a
bit in the next section.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id5">
<img alt="_images/Jean-Auguste-Dominique_Ingres_-_Comtesse_dHaussonville_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" src="_images/Jean-Auguste-Dominique_Ingres_-_Comtesse_dHaussonville_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Now let´s look at the more “incomprehensible” stuff, the switch in mindset to see like a painter.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vision">
<h2>#3: Vision<a class="headerlink" href="#vision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As already mentioned, the sense of vision is very much neglected with the average person. Other senses are more
pragmatic. What we are usually concerned with when going outside is the weather(Is it warm or cold? Is it
raining?). Who cares about the mosaic of shapes and colors on the retina of the eye?
As painters we need to take these mental ideas and convert them to something tangible, namely the shapes
and colors hitting the retina of our eyes.
Light hits our eyes and creates a 2-dimensional image. The canvas works the same way.
Even Harold Speed says that teaching people to SEE should be GENERAL education.
How can we expect to design or create something new from imagination, when we can´t even paint what we see?</p>
<div class="section" id="flat-colors">
<h3>#1: Flat Colors<a class="headerlink" href="#flat-colors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>People´s ideas of colors of objects are different from what we see from our visual perception. For example, if we
think about an apple, we think of the outline of the apple and it being red.
Maybe you might even shade it with some “Form”. But the truth is, from a visual standpoint, the apple looks totally
different. See below, how the “real” apple is simplified and can be broken down into a mosaic of flat color patches.
Instead of Form, all we have are Patterns of Colors.
<strong>The Forms that we can feel with the sense of touch always stays the same, while appearance of objects
always change in our Vision.</strong>
What do I mean by that? If you look around you, depending on the angle you look at things, they always appear to
look different. The patterns of colors on your retina change all the time.
When thinking with that mindset, it actually doesn´t matter what you paint. Be it drapery, the human figure,
landscapes, still lives or architecture. In the end, everything is just a bunch of “color patches” on the canvas that
is caused by a certain light condition. You can paint anything that you want. Instead of having to memorize all the
forms in the “Form Mindset”, now you can just paint what you see. For the same reason, it also doesn´t make
sense to memorize color formulas, like how to paint a certain skin tone, because we perceive them differently all
the time depending on the light and skin material behaviour.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id6">
<img alt="_images/Apples-1.jpg" src="_images/Apples-1.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Two apple simplified into into simple shapes. See how the colors are changed dynamically because of the light situation.</span></p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, we hardly recognize the apple as an apple anymore. For the Non-Painter, this is fairly
incomprehensible, because it doesn´t represent or suggests any subject matter. Only when completed as the
representation of things and with the association with other senses, can it be fully understood(i. e. delicious
looking apple). As an artist, our goal in the end is to convey those other associations through the visual aspect of
the painting.
Let´s look at another example.
Looking at an image upside-down will reset our affinity to see “things” and instead we just see a bunch of colors,
before we start to try to identify the “objects” again.
In painting, you need to be able to look at things just like this bunch of colors instead of “things”.</p>

<div class="section" id="direct-painting">
<h3>#2: Direct Painting<a class="headerlink" href="#direct-painting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Around 1600, Dutch painter Frans Hals and Spanish painter Diego Velázquez incorporated more and more of
these visual aspects into their paintings. The result is a more truthful representation of what we SEE. We can
already see that they tried to combine the idea of Form with the visual representation of things seen. Study them,
because Sargent, Sorolla and Zorn were highly influenced by them.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="impressionism">
<h3>#3: Impressionism<a class="headerlink" href="#impressionism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The history of western art developed from a plain painting system and culminated in the Impressionist
Movement.
Impressionistic painting is a revolt against those formulas of rendering paintings(which is a lot concerned with technical
knowledge). Instead, by painting what we SEE, we can start to paint whatever we want.
Impressionism takes everything a bit further and ignores every sense of form and just notices the effect of light on
the retina as it is. That means you can just paint what you SEE as shapes of colors without having to memorize
anatomy or lighting formulas.
In the world of Impressionism, light situations change all the time. Everything we SEE as shapes on the retina
changes ALL THE TIME. This gives us freedom in painting whatever we want.
The painting style of earlier centuries were restricted due to their skill-cap of having to memorize every bit of
anatomy and relied upon remembering coloring “formulas”. These “coloring formulas” are very apparent in beginning painters today.
If YOU want to improve, you need to start a personal revolt against your current “form” painting system and start
employ a radical impressionistic mindset(and combine these two later; see #4).
Start by going for a walk and see how the color shapes on your retina changes all the time. And how everything
you see consists of ever-changing shapes. This is the specialty of the new “Shape Mindset” and which will go.
against any “color and rendering” systems.
Instead of carefully painted finished images without any visible brushstrokes, the Impressionist Painting
style is free in expression, bold, and captures a sense of life and nature similar to the way we see. We see
the totality of the visual impression. Objects, backgrounds and atmosphere become one.
This painting style let´s us become free from the restrictions of painting systems and boundaries as well as careful
planning.
People might say that the drawing skills in these paintings might look “horrendous”. In fact, Impressionists were
often criticized for not being able to draw and for producing “unfinished paintings”, but this is not the focus in
impressionistic paintings. From a pure vision standpoint, these paintings were a pure work of art. Just look at the
selection of colors and the representation of the light effects. This was never done before it´s time.
Monet famously used a series of Haystack paintings to show the effect of light at various times of day, seasons
and weather types.
Here are just some examples of these:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/grainstacks-at-the-end-of-summer-morning-effect.jpg" src="_images/grainstacks-at-the-end-of-summer-morning-effect.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/grainstacks-at-giverny-morning-effect.jpg" src="_images/grainstacks-at-giverny-morning-effect.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/haystacks-sun-in-the-mist.jpg" src="_images/haystacks-sun-in-the-mist.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Do you see, how there is freedom in painting whatever you see? Without having to rely on knowledge of Forms?
Impressionists focuses on light and color. By painting what you SEE, you get a more accurate representation of
the world and how color and light reacts in a truthful way.
Let´s look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of this mindset:
Great paintings can be deemed as “unfinished”. But by painting in all the details and by rendering endlessly we
might lose some of the expression and emotional quality of the painting.
<strong>To the Non-Painter, good paintings are only finished or representative paintings, because they are not
looking for the visual quality of the painting, but for the descriptive nature of the work of art.
However for the Painter, a painting is finished when the emotional idea has been realised, not when the
painting has enough details to represent everything.</strong>
That is not to say, that we should paint in a completely 2-dimensional and abstract way. Impressionism loses the
quality of Line Drawing, which makes for the majority of the expression. Combining both will give you a complete
representation.
In the end, we need to have a fine balance between the Abstract 2-dimensional “Shape Mindset” and the 3-
dimensional concept of Form.
<strong>The Radical Mindset of Impressionists is
not very practical, due to the “Loose Drawing” and “Unfinished Painting” quality. However, for creativity
and education reason, studying in this manner is indispensable and vital for your development as a
painter.
To put this new mindset to use in your -final paintings-, combine both Touch and Vision into one whole.</strong>
Some of the greatest paintings are done by combining both, which is what we will discuss in the next section.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>

</div>
<div class="section" id="combining-touch-and-vision">
<h2>#4: Combining Touch and Vision<a class="headerlink" href="#combining-touch-and-vision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/FormShape-1.jpg" src="_images/FormShape-1.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The extrema of Impressionism removes much of the beauty of line. And when we want to retrieve that, we need to
start and combine both views(Form and Vision) into one full expression. If you employed Vision into your workflow,
you should be able to handle Values and Colors pretty well. This is when you start to combine Form and Vision
and make your work full of expression.
Let´s look at Sorolla. He was well-known for his use of colors, but still employs form into his figures.
In his studies, he would study both separately.
Here is a study of Form:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id10">
<img alt="_images/ba39812b07f4dc28ab95bcd8d6289a1b.jpg" src="_images/ba39812b07f4dc28ab95bcd8d6289a1b.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida – A preliminary study, that focuses on the study of 3-dimensional Forms.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Here he completely ignores Form and only studies how the Pattern of Colors relate in a 2-dimensional way:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id11">
<img alt="_images/the-beach-at-biarritz-sketch.jpg" src="_images/the-beach-at-biarritz-sketch.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida – In this compositional color study, only shapes are employed to study the 2-dimensional color
pattern.</span></p>
</div>
<p>We can see how Sorolla stays with 2D Shapes in his color compositions and also makes form studies with
charcoal. In his final paintings he combines both Form and Shapes for a <strong>full expression</strong>.
Now Form isn´t only defined by arbitrary values and colors, but they relate to the truthful lighting of the scene.
The secret here is to still think about 2D Shapes and it´s design while rendering the 3D Form.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id12">
<img alt="_images/summer-1904.jpg" src="_images/summer-1904.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida – Summer</span></p>
</div>
<p>The same procedure can be seen in Sargent´s and Zorn´s work.
To be able to combine both, you need to be able to accurately paint the shape and think about the plane and
form at the same time.
Another quick note:
If we render forms continually or break down shapes further and further, then the end result will look the same:
A realistic representation of what we see.
It is really our choice to balance out the way we handle forms and shapes.
Here is another quick example to show you how styles can change depending on YOUR choice of handling.
Isaac Levitan was a Russian landscape painter. Even though Levitan was a painter of Realism, most of his later
paintings display his handling of color and light and his influence by Impressionism. Notice the truthful
representation of the light effect.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to study countless of Master Artists for their use of form and shapes. Once you
understand it fully you can start to play around with these instruments, develop your own artistic style and have a
professional approach to your own paintings.
Both touch and vision are important for a full expression of a painting. However, vision is often neglected or not
developed due to human evolution. Before you become proficient at painting, you need to train your vision
and start to see things as 2-dimensional color shapes on our retina.
Only after you have become proficient at touch and vision separately, can you start to combine both for a full
expression of your painting.
In the end, your task is to SEE both form and shape.</p>
